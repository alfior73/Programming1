Description: 
 * LongJumps - Write a program that uses an array to store 3 jumps taken in a track meet by a Long Jumper (in meters).  
 * Using a loop, prompt the user for the three jump distances.  
 * The program should use another loop to find the longest jump.  
 * The program should use a third loop to find the average jump.  
 * Display the longest jump and average jumps.
